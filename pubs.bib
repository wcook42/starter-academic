	abstract = {Drawing from research on role modeling, the impact of harassment on third-parties, and trends in online harassment, we propose that exposure to cyberharassment of an admired role model can incite a negative shift in the observer-role model relationship. This negative shift will decrease the observer’s aspiration for a career in the role model’s industry/occupation or with the same level of public visibility. As role models are particularly influential for members of marginalized groups, and because sharing a social identity with a role model makes it easier for one to imagine achieving similar outcomes as the role model, we propose that this effect is more pronounced when the observer and role model share membership in a marginalized group. In developing this theory, we highlight a potential ‘dark side’ of role modeling.},

	abstract = {Drawing from moral foundations theory, we show that differences in sensitivity to distinct moral norms help explain differences in the perceived (un)fairness of punishing employees for off-duty deviance. We used an initial study to validate realistic examples of non-criminal behavior that were perceived as violating a specific moral foundation. Participants in the main study (n = 166) evaluated scenarios in which co-workers were fired for those behaviors, which took place outside of work but were revealed via social media. The extent to which participants valued the norm violated by the co-worker positively predicted perceived fairness of the firing, and negatively predicted expressed intent to take retributive action against the responsible manager. This effect was moderated by the presence of a pre-existing organizational policy regarding off-duty conduct, which uniformly decreased negative reactions to the firing. Because social media now makes the revelation of an employee’s off-duty behavior to a broad audience increasingly likely, our results suggest the importance of developing an approach for responding to employee off-duty deviance while highlighting the relevance of moral pluralism to the study of third-party reactions.},
